    "## 0:00 Intro\n",
    "Welcome, Roblox Lua scripters!  \n",
    "Today, weâ€™re diving deep into **Bindable Events** & **Bindable Functions**, the silent heroes of internal script communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "They don't go over the network â€” they are **local to the same game server** or **local to the same client**.  \n",
    "Think of them as \"walkie-talkies\" between scripts that live on the same device.\n",

    "## 1:11 CONCEPTION\n",
    "**Why Bindables?**  \n",
    "- Scripts often need to talk to each other.  \n",
    "- RemoteEvents/RemoteFunctions are for **Client â†” Server** communication.  \n",
    "- **Bindables are for Script â†” Script** communication **within** the same environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Server Script sends a \"treasure opened\" event to another server script.\n",
    "- LocalScript tells another LocalScript that a UI button was clicked.\n",

    "## 2:35 Bindable Event\n",
    "BindableEvent lets you **fire** and **listen** for custom events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a BindableEvent in Roblox Studio\n",
    "1. Right-click in Explorer â†’ Insert **BindableEvent**.\n",
    "2. Place it in **ReplicatedStorage** (if both scripts need to access it).\n",
